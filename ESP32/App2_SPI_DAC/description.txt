In this exercise it was suposed to write the values of 3 wave types in the eeprom. It would then read the values writen in the memory and generate the corresponding wave in the dac channel 1. Using a timer, in a period of 10 sec it would change the wave type being generated. It was not possible to write or read in the memory, so the program doesn't work.
