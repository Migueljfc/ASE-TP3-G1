Reads the temperature value from the TC74 sensor and sends to the Raspberry Pi 
GPIO pin 4 used to power the sensor. Only powers on for 0.5 seconds then waits for the time read in the beginning (default is 1.5 second)
When the sensor is reading the led is turned on
In the end writes in a file the time and the value read
